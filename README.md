# CE426-Autonomous-Car
2017 Winter CE 426 Project - Autonomous Car

### Instructions  
Create a branch for your project and work only on that branch. Create branches off the "develop" branch. Commit as frequently as you'd like. When your feature is ready to be deployed to the car either merge with develop branch or tell me and I will merge with develop. When the feature is tested we will merge it with the master branch.
